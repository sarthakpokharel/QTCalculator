# Qt Calculator üßÆ

This is a simple calculator app I built while learning **C++ and Qt**.  
The goal was to get comfortable with **Qt Widgets, signals/slots, and UI events** ‚Äî nothing fancy yet, just the basics working.

---

## Features
- Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Clear/reset button
- Shows what you type in real time
- Built with Qt Designer (for the UI) + C++ backend
- Works on desktop (Windows/Linux/macOS)

‚ö†Ô∏è Right now it just does operations **left to right** (no BODMAS). So `2+3*4` will give `20`, not `14`.

---

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qt-calculator.git

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

Stuff I‚Äôd like to add later:

Proper operator precedence (BODMAS)

Decimal/floating point support

Prettier UI

<h2>Why I Built This</h2>

I‚Äôve been doing a lot of web development (Spring Boot, Angular, Python), but I‚Äôm learning Qt/C++ because I want to get into desktop and embedded systems.
This is my ‚Äúhello world‚Äù project for Qt üöÄ
